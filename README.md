## MFC OVERVIEW AND HISTORY -
It was 1992, and Windows was still running as a 16bit operating system layered on top of MS-DOS when Microsoft introduced its Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to developers. Most applications for Windows had previously been written in C, but C++ was starting to take off, and the C++ developers were craving an object-oriented way of developing Windows applications, to match the ease of VB, which had been released a year earlier, but with the flexibility of C / C++.

Back then, Microsoftâ€™s C++ compiler did not have exception handling, templates, nor did it have a standard library of containers and algorithms that took advantage of the C++ language features. As such, MFC used macros to emulate templates and exceptions and created its own set of containers for generic concepts such as strings, arrays, lookup maps and more. Well beyond the brief of object-oriented and easier access the Windows APIs.

## Sprint
## Day 1 -(21/06/24)
1.MFC Dialog MSDN Docs read.<br/>
2.Steps needed in VS Code to setup a CDialog for First authentication page.
3.Control Management button added
4.Worked on further occured errors 

## Day 2- (22/06/24)
1. Created the Username and Password button and worked on related functions.
2. Learned about Modal and Modalless Dialog boxes.
3.  Extensively checked for CDialog and CdialogEx classes and which is more flexible to use.
   
## Modal and Modaless Dialog Box
- You can use class CDialog to manage two kinds of dialog boxes:
- Modal dialog boxes, which require the user to respond before continuing the program
- Modeless dialog boxes, which stay on the screen and are available for use at any time but permit other user activities
- The resource editing and procedures for creating a dialog template are the same for modal and modeless dialog boxes.
- Creating a dialog box for your program requires the following steps:
- Use the dialog editor to design the dialog box and create its dialog-template resource.
- Create a dialog class.
- Connect the dialog resource's controls to message handlers in the dialog class.
- Add data members associated with the dialog box's controls and to specify dialog data exchange and dialog data validations for the controls.

# Creating Modal Dialog boxes in MFC
To create a modal dialog box, call either of the two public constructors declared in CDialog. Next, call the dialog object's DoModal member function to display the dialog box and manage interaction with it until the user chooses OK or Cancel. This management by DoModal is what makes the dialog box modal. For modal dialog boxes, DoModal loads the dialog resource.

4.Worked on further occured errors 

## Day 3- (23/06/24)
1. Warpped up the user_login dialog box.
2. Started Linking the create account button using modal dialog with userlogin dialog page.
3. Further resolved errors occured

## KeyNotes
- CDialogEx why used and not why CDialog dialog box.
- Difference between GetDlgItem, GetDlgItemText,GetWindowText and GetWindowTextLength
- Usage of CString , CStringA, std:: string

## Day 4- (24/06/24)
1. Setup Mysql for database, configured the version
2. Downloaded and setup the MYSQL Workbench.
3. Reasearched on connection OF DATABASE with Mfc as frontend and C++ as backend.

## Key Learnings
- ConnectToDatabase () function implementation:
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f23f4234-5ed6-4a16-a95f-e7b89debaca3)

## Purpose
The function ConnectToDatabase aims to establish a connection to a MySQL database. It returns true if the connection is successful and false otherwise.
## Detailed Explanation
bool CUserRegistrationSystem2Dlg::ConnectToDatabase() {
- Return Type: bool - Indicates whether the connection to the database was successful (true) or not (false).
- Class Scope: CUserRegistrationSystem2Dlg:: - This function is a member of the - 
 CUserRegistrationSystem2Dlg class.

## Variable Declaration and Initialization
- sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver* driver
- sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance(); 
- sql::mysql::MySQL_Driver* driver: Declares a pointer to a MySQL_Driver instance.
- sql::mysql::get_mysql_driver_instance(): Static method that returns a pointer to the MySQL driver singleton instance. This driver is necessary for connecting to a MySQL database.
## Establishing Connection
- con = std::unique_ptr<sql::Connection>(driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "root", "Missspacegirl@09"));
con: Assumes con is a member variable of type
- std::unique_ptr<sql::Connection>, which manages the database connection.
- driver->connect("tcp://127.0.0.1:3306", "root", "Missspacegirl@09"): Establishes a connection to the MySQL server at the specified address (127.0.0.1:3306). The connect method requires:
- The server address (tcp://127.0.0.1:3306).
- The username (root).
- The password (Missspacegirl@09).
- Setting the Database Schema 
- con->setSchema("user_register");
- con->setSchema("user_register"): Sets the default schema (database) for the connection to user_register. This means all subsequent SQL queries will operate within the user_register database unless specified otherwise.
- Returning Success
return true;
If all previous operations are successful, the function returns true, indicating the connection was successful.
-Exception Handling
catch (sql::SQLException& e) {
catch (sql::SQLExcept)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac7a404-9cbb-4d6c-a556-1b647c2e0f51)

## Purpose
The function DoesUserExist checks if a user with the specified username and password exists in the database.
- bool CUserRegistrationSystem2Dlg::DoesUserExist() {
Return Type: bool - Indicates whether the user exists (true) or not (false).
### Common For all Dialog Boxes- CUserRegistrationDlg, CCreateAccountDlg, CCLeadLockingDlg
### Step 1: Connect to the Database
-if (!ConnectToDatabase())
    return false;
-ConnectToDatabase(): Calls the ConnectToDatabase method to establish a connection to the database.
-Check Connection: If the connection fails, the function returns false.
### Step 2: Query Execution within a Try-Catch Block
- Declaration and Preparation of SQL Statement
try {
    std::unique_ptr<sql::PreparedStatement> pstmt;
    std::unique_ptr<sql::ResultSet> res;
    pstmt.reset(con->prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"));
- pstmt: A unique pointer to a PreparedStatement object for executing parameterized SQL queries.
- res: A unique pointer to a ResultSet object to store the query results.
- con->prepareStatement(...): Prepares the SQL statement with placeholders (?) for the username and password parameters to prevent SQL injection.
- Setting Parameters and Executing the Query
    CStringA usernameA(Username);
    CStringA passwordA(Password);
    pstmt->setString(1, std::string(usernameA));
    pstmt->setString(2, std::string(passwordA));
    res.reset(pstmt->executeQuery());
- CStringA usernameA(Username);: Converts Username (assumed to be a CString member variable) to CStringA (ANSI string).
- CStringA passwordA(Password);: Converts Password (assumed to be a CString member variable) to CStringA (ANSI string).
- pstmt->setString(1, std::string(usernameA));: Sets the first parameter (username) of the prepared statement.
- pstmt->setString(2, std::string(passwordA));: Sets the second parameter (password) of the prepared statement.
- res.reset(pstmt->executeQuery());: Executes the query and stores the result in res.
return res->next();
res->next(): Advances the cursor to the next row in the result set. If a row exists, it returns true, indicating the user was found. If no rows are returned, it returns false.
### Step 3: Exception Handling
} catch (sql::SQLException& e) {
    CString errorMessage;
    errorMessage.Format(_T("Query execution failed: %S"), e.what());
    AfxMessageBox(errorMessage);
    return false;
}
catch (sql::SQLException& e): Catches any sql::SQLException that might be thrown during the execution of the SQL query.
-Error Message: Formats an error message with the exception details and displays it using AfxMessageBox.
-Return False: If an exception occurs, the function returns false.
Summary
-Connect to Database: Attempts to connect to the database. Returns false if the connection fails.
-Prepare Statement: Prepares an SQL statement to select the user based on username and password.
-Set Parameters: Sets the username and password parameters in the prepared statement.
-Execute Query: Executes the query and checks if any results are returned.
-Return Result: Returns true if a user is found, false otherwise.
-Exception Handling: Catches any SQL exceptions, displays an error message, and returns false.
- This function effectively handles database connectivity and query execution, ensuring that the application can verify user credentials securely and robustly.
## Day 10- (30/06/24)
- Implementation of CreateAccount() function for inserting into database new user.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/907690ba-1556-4c3e-9f28-3de242d87ede)
- Resolving errors related to create account dialog with user login dialog.
  ### Key Learnings
  - Implementation of try- catch block of insert function of create account.
   - try {
	-  std::unique_ptr<sql::PreparedStatement> pstmt;
	- pstmt.reset(con->prepareStatement("INSERT INTO users (`username`, `password`) VALUES (?, ?)"));
  - CStringA usernameA(Username); // used for ANSI
	- CStringA passwordA(Password);
	- pstmt->setString(1, std::string(usernameA));
	- pstmt->setString(2, std::string(passwordA));
	- pstmt->executeUpdate();
	- return true;
}
catch (sql::SQLException& e) {
	CString errorMessage;
	errorMessage.Format(_T("Account creation failed: %S"), e.what()); // %S for wide-character CString
	AfxMessageBox(errorMessage);
	return false;
}
## Day 11- (01/07/24)

- Creating Layout of the LeadLocking Form with different fields required.
- Defining the properties and type of the fields and drawn an overview to implement it.
- Different properties of field values are-
    ## Edit Controls for Input of text values-
   -  ProspectName -> not null;
   - Address -> not null;
   - StreetAddress  -> not null;
   - AddressLine2;
   - City;
   - State;
   - FirstName;
   -LastName;
   - Website;
   - Email;
  ## Combo Box for Dropdown selection-
  - SolidCAMOffice;
  - SolidCAMSalesperson;
  - Country;
  - Reseller;
### OverView of Combo Box and implementation- 
A combo box consists of a list box combined with either a static control or edit control. it is represented by CComboBox class. The list-box portion of the control may be displayed at all times or may only drop down when the user selects the drop-down arrow next to the control.

- Initialization
CBN_SELCHANGE	ON_CBN_SELCHANGE( <id>, <memberFxn> )	The selection in the list box of a combo box is about to be changed as a result of the user either clicking in the list box or changing the selection by using the arrow keys.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5383bceb-a9e2-40bb-a7e4-650628216f26)

### COleDateTime m_DateTime;
### COleDateTime m_DateTime2;

The date and time picker control (CDateTimeCtrl) implements an intuitive and recognizable method of entering or selecting a specific date. The main interface of the control is similar in functionality to a combo box. However, if the user expands the control, a month calendar control appears (by default), allowing the user to specify a particular date. When a date is chosen, the month calendar control automatically disappears.

### Static Text
A static control displays a text string, box, rectangle, icon, cursor, bitmap, or enhanced metafile. It is represented by CStatic class. It can be used to label, box, or separateother controls. A static control normally takes no input and provides no output.
### Phone Number - implementation 




## CURL LIBRARY Implementaion
   
-Client URL, or just curl, is a command-line tool for transferring data using v arious network protocols. It is commonly used by developers to test various applications build on top of HTTP.

-That said, curl itself is just a wrapper around libcurl. The library is written in C and has well documented API.

## Imp
If you use libcurl from a C++ program, it is important to remember that you cannot pass in a string object where libcurl expects a string. ## It has to be a null terminated C string. Usually you can make this happen with the c_str() method.

For example, keep the URL in a string object and set that in the handle:
std::string url("https://example.com/");
curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, url.c_str());

## STEPS TO DO CURL OPERATION 
- Before you do anything libcurl related in your program, you should do a global libcurl initialize call with curl_global_init(). This is necessary because some underlying libraries that libcurl might be using need a call ahead to get setup and initialized properly.

- curl_global_init() is, unfortunately, not thread safe, so you must ensure that you only do it once and never simultaneously with another call. It initializes global state so you should only call it once, and once your program is completely done using libcurl you can call curl_global_cleanup() to free and clean up the associated global resources the init call allocated.

- libcurl is built to handle the situation where you skip the curl_global_init() call, but it does so by calling it itself instead (if you did not do it before any actual file transfer starts) and it then uses its own defaults
- Easy handle.The fundamentals you need to learn with libcurl.First you create an "easy handle", which is your handle to a transfer, really:
- CURL *easy_handle = curl_easy_init();
- You then set options in that handle to control the upcoming transfer. This example sets the URL:
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98911a02-5ec2-45d6-9e7f-84acfe1d4a9c)
- Eg from code 
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87d108c2-22a2-4f03-95ca-f146503a5036)
- CString: CString is a string class provided by MFC that simplifies string manipulation. It handles memory management automatically, making it easier to work with strings compared to raw character arrays.

- CString::Format: The Format method of CString works similarly to the printf function in C. It allows you to create formatted strings by inserting variables into a format string. Here, apiEndpoint.Format constructs the complete API endpoint URL by inserting apiKey and m_GSTNumber into the format string.
- Compatibility: Using _T ensures that the code can be compiled for both Unicode and ANSI builds without modification.
- Ease of Use: CString provides convenient methods for string manipulation, reducing the likelihood of errors compared to manually managing character arrays.
- Readability: The Format method makes it easy to see how the URL is constructed, improving code readability.
- Alternative Approach without _T and CString::Format
If you are working exclusively with standard C++ strings and don't need MFC compatibility, you could use std::string and std::stringstream:

#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::string apiKey = "f4f459b60c3351483570f552eaa3cb79";
std::string m_GSTNumber = "someGSTNumber"; // Assume m_GSTNumber is a std::string

std::stringstream ss;
ss << "http://sheet.gstincheck.co.in/check/" << apiKey << "/" << m_GSTNumber;
std::string apiEndpoint = ss.str();

- res = curl_easy_setopt(easy_handle, CURLOPT_URL, "http://example.com/");
If curl_easy_setopt() returns CURLE_OK, we know it stored the option fine.
- curl_easy_init(): Initializes the CURL library for making HTTP requests (curl is a handle to the CURL session).
  ## curl_easy_setopt()- consists of 3 parameters
- curl_easy_setopt
curl_easy_setopt is a function from the libcurl library used to set various options for a CURL session handle. This function allows you to specify details about the transfer, such as the URL to fetch, how to handle the response data, timeouts, and more.
CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLoption option, parameter);
handle: The CURL session handle obtained from curl_easy_init.
option: The specific option to set, defined by the CURLoption enum.
parameter: The value to set for the specified option, which can vary in type depending on the option.
- curl_easy_setopt(): Sets various options for the CURL session:
- CURLOPT_URL: Sets the URL to fetch.
- CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION: Sets a callback function (WriteCallback) to handle the response data.
- CURLOPT_WRITEDATA: Passes &readBuffer to receive the response data.
- curl_easy_perform(): Performs the HTTP GET request. If an error occurs (res != CURLE_OK), it displays an error message using AfxMessageBox and returns false
